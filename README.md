Purpose:
1) Clean indoor air
2) Contribute to DIY clean air engineering developed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
3) Encourage an understanding of the principles of clean air
4) Highlight the importance of increasing manufacturing, engineering, industry and design in Europe

The attached templates were prototyped and tested using a Dholetec 150W CO2 laser with a 1000x700mm bed.  3mm MDF is the material intended for use with these templates.  Effective settings on this laser were 65 power and 24 speed.

The pieces for broken frame templates can be arranged to fit on a single ~970x600mm sheet of MDF.  The solid frame templates required two sheets of MDF on the Dholetec.  A laser cutter with a larger bed could accommodate the solid frame template on one sheet.

These templates have been designed around what can be sourced within Europe.  This means parts that might not have been manufactured locally but can be purchased in retail locations around large and medium sized European cities.  Depending on the availability of electronics accessories locally it is likely that some parts must be ordered online and shipped great distances.  Though it often requires more effort than online retailers, it is emphatically encouraged to source parts locally.


Parts:
MDF 3mm thickness - if aiming to print on a single sheet, a size at least 970mmx600mm
4 140mm PC Fans - recommended Arctic P14 of 1700rpm or better
2 Ikea Starkvind air filters
For affixing the fans - 8 4x80mm or longer screws & 8 4mm nuts (if not available then 8 4x20mm screws & 8 4x40mm screws & 16 4mm nuts)
Power supply 12v to 5.5x2.1mm "barrel plug" - minimum 1.0A
Adapter 5.5x2.1mm cable to 4 pin connector*
Optional handle - EITHER 1 strap (any material) 55cm long, or 1 kitchen handle (D shaped is ideal)
For affixing the handle - 2 4x12mm screws & 2 4mm nuts (wide latitude for different screw types for affixing the handle, these are just a recommendation)

*This is the most frustrating piece to source.  Though an adapter of this type could be simply made with locally sourced parts, the labor involved versus the price of the part makes it a difficult tradeoff.  For Europe I recommend AliExpress using a search term like "5521 adapter 4 pin"


File guide:
There are 4 separate templates with variations noted in the filenames.  Each file is saved in file formats SVG and DXF.  There is also a supplemental file with fan grill designs and handle holes.  Elements in the supplemental file are meant to be incorporated into template files to allow a level of customization in the final build.  The supplemental file has fan grills in 120mm and 180mm as well and can be incorporated into projects using fans of those dimensions.

Solid Frame - refers to the outer frames holding the filter each being one solid piece
Broken Frame - refers to the outer frame holding the filter to be split or broken into smaller connecting pieces for more compact cutting
Holes - refers to prepositioned holes in the front and back of the air filter to be used for strap handle
No Holes - no holes for either a top handle or a strap, reference supplemental file for handle holes to position on the top piece of the filter
